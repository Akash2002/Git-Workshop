# Git-Workshop

Github is one of the most popular VCS systems used to organize the software development process. This repository represents the code and demo that will be used during the workshop that I am hosting at [UGA Hacks 6](https://6.ugahacks.com). The slide deck will be updated and posted on this repository along with a recording of the entire workshop for future reference.
